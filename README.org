* White-nose Syndrome simulation in Texas

** how to run a simple example

+ compile the simulation binary

Go to the ~sim/~ directory and run ~make opt~ to generate an optimised build of the simulator ~sim~.

+ generate input files

Execute ~gen.R~ in directory ~gen-landscape/~. This reads the files ~cavetemps.txt~, ~topology.txt~, and ~prism-all-counties.csv~ and creates files ~hibernacula.csv~, and ~distances.csv~, which are required as input files to the simulation.

+ copy or softlink the required files to example directory

Go to ~examples/simple/~ directory and either copy ~hibernacula.csv~, ~distances.csv~, and ~sim~ or symlink these files to the directory. Then simply execute ~./sim~ to run the simulator and generate two output files ~out-p1.csv~, and ~out-p2.csv~.
