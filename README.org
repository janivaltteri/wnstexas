* White-nose Syndrome simulation in Texas

** requirements

1. ~json.hpp~ from ~https://github.com/nlohmann/json~ placed into ~sim/nlohmann/~

2. ~program options~ from boost

** how to run examples

*** simple example

1. compile the simulation binary

Go to the ~sim/~ directory and run ~make opt~ to generate an optimised build of the simulator ~sim~.

2. generate input files

Execute ~gen.R~ in directory ~gen-landscape/~. This reads the files ~cavetemps.txt~, ~topology.txt~, and ~prism-all-counties.csv~ and creates files ~hibernacula.csv~, and ~distances.csv~, which are the required input files to the simulation.

3. copy or softlink the required files to example directory

Go to ~examples/simple/~ directory and either copy ~hibernacula.csv~, ~distances.csv~, and ~sim~ or symlink these files to the directory. 

4. run simulation

Execute ~./sim~ to run the simulator and generate two output files ~out-p1.csv~, and ~out-p2.csv~.

*** comparisons between base case, infection modes, and infection-free scenario

Steps 1-3 need to be carried out as above. Then, simulation can be executed in the ~examples/comparisons/~ directory as:

~./sim -s spec.json -p pars.txt -o out -l hibernacula.csv -d distances.csv~
